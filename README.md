# Odometer Classification and Mileage Extraction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This report covers two fundamental tasks using the TRODO dataset: Odometer Type 
Classification and Mileage Extraction. In the first task, various machine learning 
algorithms were employed to classify odometers into analog and digital types. The 
second task involved applying different machine learning algorithms to extract mileage 
values from images.
